Most of the new work I'm doing on this is going to the blog page, which uses php to read from a local mysql database. Currently, all posts are loaded from the db, but I would like to display one at a time and let the user load more as they want.\r\n\r\nYou can find hosted versions of this site at [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com), which is hosted at [name.com](http://name.com).\r\n\r\nThis site is also hosted at [copperwall.no-ip.biz](http://copperwall.no-ip.biz), which is hosted from my Raspberry Pi. New changes to the site will be shown here first, and then moved to [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com) when they are nice and ready.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
