# Bootstrap-site

This is a personal website, that I am writing with the help of Twitter's [bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).

In it's current state, the site consists of a only a homepage. I plan to add individual pages for the 'about' and 'projects' segments, but I'd like to alter the page style in order to better display the content. I haven't made a lot of progress in deciding on a different theme, so those pages are a little ways out.

You can find hosted versions of this site at [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com), which is hosted at (name.com)[http://name.com].

This site is also hosted at [copperwall.no-ip.biz](http://copperwall.no-ip.biz), which is hosted from my Raspberry Pi. New changes to the site will be shown here first, and then moved to [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com) when they are nice and ready.
