# Personal Site

This is a personal website, that I am writing with the help of [bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).

As of recently, the homepage is mostly complete. Most of the new work I'm doing on this is going to the blog page, which uses php to read from a local mysql database. Currently, all posts are loaded from the db, but I would like to display one at a time and let the user load more as they want.

You can find hosted versions of this site at [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com), which is hosted at [name.com](http://name.com).

This site is also hosted at [copperwall.no-ip.biz](http://copperwall.no-ip.biz), which is hosted from my Raspberry Pi. New changes to the site will be shown here first, and then moved to [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com) when they are nice and ready.
