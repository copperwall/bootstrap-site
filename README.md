# Personal Site

This is a personal website, that I am writing with the help of [bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).

As of recently, the homepage is mostly complete. Most of the new work I'm doing on this is going to the blog page, which uses php to read from a local mysql database. Currently, all posts are loaded from the db, but I would like to display one at a time and let the user load more as they want.

This site is hosted at [chrisopperwall.com](http://chrisopperwall.com), which is hosted from my Raspberry Pi. New changes to the site will be shown here.

## Update

I have moved my production hosting to my Raspberry Pi, so now I will have to find another testing environment to use.
